            <h1>Specification: Flex Menu</h1>
            <h2>Session Type</h2>
            The flex menu session types clearly define the usage life cycle of 
            flex menu objects. Session types allows a program to further state 
            how it should be used by clients, including human users.
            <ul>
                <li>INIT     = &{<b>new</b>: POPULATE};</li>
                <li>POPULATE = &{<b>populate</b>: SERVE};</li>
                <li>SERVE    = &{<b>listen</b>: REACT};</li>
                <li>REACT    = +{<i>Event_1</i>: &{<b>action_1</b>: SERVE}, ..., <i>Event_n</i>: &{<b>action_n</b> : SERVE}}}</li>
            </ul>

            <p>INIT:
                This is the start point of the menu's interaction usage life cycle. 
                A client must start by creating a new instance (<b>new</b>).</p>

            <p>POPULATE:
                After creation the flex menu will be ready to be populated. For the 
                client perspective it resumes to calling <b>populate()</b> method; 
                internally it will initialize the menu bar, search and logout buttons, 
                each with their own session type. Respective to it's internal 
                components the flex menu is just another client, hence subjected to
                use them according to their session types.</p>

            <p>SERVE:
                User interaction components constantly <b>listen</b> to user and system 
                events, and reacts accordingly. When user or system event is fired
                the object leaves the listening stage and switches on occurred event
                types</p>
        </div>

        <div id="design">
            <h1>Design: Flex Menu</h1>
            <h2>Structure</h2>
            The Flex menu is the global user interaction tool with the flex app.
            The following relationships are true:
            <ul>
                <li>FlexMenu <b>implements</b> FlexMenuI</li>
                <li>Flex Menu <i>uses</i> Menu Bar</li>
                <li>Flex Menu <i>uses</i> Search Button</li>
                <li>Flex Menu <i>uses</i> Logout Button</li>
            </ul>  

            The Flex menu delegates user interaction to internal components.
